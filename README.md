# What is Cloning Club?
Cloning Club (CC) is a monthly challenge where participants attempt to recreate a specific mechanic from an existing game. The goal isn't to completely clone the game, but rather try your hand at building a new system and sharing it with the rest of the community. 

## Deadlines
Submissions for on the mechanic/game starts on the 1st of every month. Submissions close on the 2nd of the month and a poll is then taken in Slack (https://madisongamedev.slack.com). The submission with the most votes on the 3rd day is selected for the month. Participants have until the end of the month to recreate the selected mechanic!

## Submissions Requirements
* Built with Unity
* Uploaded to Github and shared in Slack
