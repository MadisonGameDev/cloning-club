# What?
Cloning Club (CC) is a monthly-ish event where participants attempt to recreate a _specific mechanic_ from an existing game. 

# Why?
The goal isn't to completely clone the game, but rather try your hand at building a new system and sharing it with the rest of the community. This is not a contest or competition, but a way to try new things and recieve code reviews.

# Where?
Any where you want because there isn't a formal in-person event. The whole thing is run online over the community Slack (https://madisongamedev.slack.com) and Github. However participants are welcome to meetup during/after and discuss their submissions.

# When?
The event is not set on a repeating schedule, but does have a structured timeline:
1. __Nominations (3 days)__. Game/mechanics are nominated for the event. Participants should follow the Nomination Guidelines below.
2. __Voting (1 day)__. A poll is created based on nominations. Results of the poll will determine the game/mechanic for the event. 
3. __Development (30 days)__. Participants have until the end of the month to recreate the selected mechanic!
4. __Review (???)__. This period doesn't have a fixed timeline as people are encouraged to talk about submissions for as long as they want.

# How?
You are welcome to join the event at any stage. Participate in the whole event or only leave feedback for submissions. Its up to you! Individual event details can be found in the [event folder](https://github.com/MadisonGameDev/cloning-club/events).

* implement the chosen mechanic (duh)
* be built with Unity
* upload your implementation Github
